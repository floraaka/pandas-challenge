    " ## Budget vs. Test Results \n",
    " The concern with PyCity Schools turned out to be quite enlightening with regards to the effects that budgets have on a school’s test results. Surprisingly, there was a low correlation between the total resources available within a school and the school’s performance in standardized tests. This implies in the context of this research that, rising the total commonly restricted does not directly lead to enhanced academic performance. All the same, schools that spent more money per student did record improved performance. Particularly, the institutions that addressed $585 or more for each student received better outcomes which proved the idea that investing in individual student resources is better than increasing the total school expenditure. \n",
    " \n",
    " ## School Size and Performance \n",
    " School size comparison shows a substantial difference in performance outcomes of schools. Conducted analysis revealed that the smaller and medium schools were performing better than large schools and especially in mathematics. For example, the passing rate in mathematics was; in small and medium size schools the passing rate was 89% to 91% while in large school, the passing rate was as low as 67%. This is an implication that schools that are small and those that are of a medium size offer the best learning environment that fulfills the needs of the children hence, better results would have been get. \n",
    " \n",
    " ## School Type and Performance \n",
    " In making the comparison of the kinds of schools, it was noticeable in the study that Charter schools had a higher performance in all the parameters as compared to the District Public Schools. Charter schools scored better in mathematics and reading as well as had better passing rates. This may be due to such factors as the implementation of some new practices in education or the smaller number of learners that is usually observed in the charter schools, thus enabling the teachers to tailor their activities accordingly. Nevertheless, more data are required to identify whether the results are attributed to the application of such practices by charter schools or the fact that such schools are generally associated with fewer students enrolled.\n"
